This sample app demonstrates how parametrically design a building - in this case a warehouse - in a simplified manner.

The goal of this app is to demonstrate how the VIKTOR platform is used in the structural engineering industry. This
app shows in a simplified manner how engineers can make parametrized models of commonly designed structured, such as 
warehouses, that can be used to quickly generate one or multiple designs to make better designs in a shorter period of time.

Although this app only displays the visual design of the warehouse, the app could be expanded to do structural analyses 
with integrated software packages, or export possibilities for further detailed modelling in dedicated software packages.
